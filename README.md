## Description
Application in developed in MVC architecture. <br>
There are three kinds of models - student, company, job all are stored in models folder. This is `SPA` and all the navigtion is done 
using angular router. 
The angular has been built but I have still attached the angular-src.

## Basic Architecture

* There are two types of users - students and companies and three models
student, company, jobs.
* Companies and students both have a separate login-signup, for companies
index in their email address, for student their college enrollment number.
* All the profile pages are guarded using jwt token
* Companies can post jobs, which are then shown in their dashboard with a
button to see the details of applied students.
* Students can see all the posted jobs and can apply for the job, they canâ€™t
however unregister for the website of unregister their job application.

## NPM packages used

* `passport-jwt` for user authentication
* `bcrypt.js` for password hashing and verification
* `angular-jwt` for authGuard
* `nodemon` for server rs
